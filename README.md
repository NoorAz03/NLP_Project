This project aims to detect hate speech on social media platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Using a Decision Tree Classifier to analyse English tweets categorized as hate speech, offensive language, and neutral, the project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to identify effective strategies for automated hate speech detection.

The data used in this project consists of tweets labelled as hate speech, offensive language, and neutral. The dataset used is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset and is cited in the paper.

Submitted as a part of the Natural Language Processing and Text Mining course in HFU supervised by Professor Leonardo Noriega.
